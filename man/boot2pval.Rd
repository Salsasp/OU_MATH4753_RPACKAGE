\title{Bootstrap-based Hypothesis Testing Function}
\usage{
boot2pval(x1, x2, conf.level = 0.95, iter = 3000, mudiff = 0, test = "two")
}
\arguments{
\item{x1}{A numeric vector representing the first sample.}

\item{x2}{A numeric vector representing the second sample.}

\item{conf.level}{A numeric value representing the confidence level for the test (default is 0.95).}

\item{iter}{An integer specifying the number of bootstrap iterations (default is 3000).}

\item{mudiff}{A numeric value representing the hypothesized difference in means under the null hypothesis (default is 0).}

\item{test}{A character string specifying the type of test: "two" for two-tailed, "upper" for upper-tailed, or "lower" for lower-tailed.}
}
\value{
A list with the following element:
\item{pvalue}{The estimated p-value for the hypothesis test.}
}
\description{
This function performs a bootstrap-based hypothesis test to compute a p-value for the difference
between two sample means. It also provides a histogram of the bootstrap t-statistics, highlighting
the critical regions based on the test type.
}
\details{
The function uses resampling techniques to generate bootstrap samples from the input data.
It calculates the test statistic for each resample and uses these values to estimate the p-value
based on the type of hypothesis test specified. A histogram of the bootstrap t-statistics is plotted,
highlighting the rejection regions.

\examples{
# Example 1: Two-tailed test
set.seed(123)
x1 <- rnorm(10, mean = 5, sd = 2)
x2 <- rnorm(10, mean = 7, sd = 2)
result <- boot2pval(x1, x2, conf.level = 0.95, iter = 1000, mudiff = 0, test = "two")
print(result$pvalue)

# Example 2: Upper-tailed test
result_upper <- boot2pval(x1, x2, conf.level = 0.95, iter = 1000, mudiff = 0, test = "upper")
print(result_upper$pvalue)
